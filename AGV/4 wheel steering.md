#### Factors affect steering
front drive/rear drive
centre of mass
Steering
steering direction same as front wheel in high speed*
steering direction opposite as front wheel in low speed
## Calculation of steering angle
From pivot point, (center of rotation),
$R=a_2^2+L^2(\frac{cot\theta_i+cot\theta_o}{2})^2$
